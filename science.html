                        In the class I learned about the following topics:
                        
                        Quadratic equations and functions
                        
                        Polynomials & rational expressions, graphing functions, and rate of change & slope
                        
                        Systems of equations and inequalities & radicals
                        
                        Absolute value & the function concept, statistics & probability, and additional topics
                        
                        I found Teaching Textbooks the most useful resource in learning the material. I felt like the problems of the week were helpful in relating what I
                        learned to real life.
                        
                        The most difficult part of the class was the problems of the week, as they were often quite different from what I was learning. However, they were
                        still useful and not overly hard with the materials provided with them. I wouldn't change anything about this class.</td></tr>
